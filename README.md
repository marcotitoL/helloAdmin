# helloAdmin

this is an admin panel i made for the helloAPI i wrote. this consumes the api endpoints directly. doesn't have any dbcontext or entities inside.

## What does this admin panel do?

it mostly uses all the endpoints of helloAPI save for the transactions and user registrations. CRUD for products, categories as well as account management for the logged in user.
When i say user here mostly just the super admin, lol.

### Things I learned while doing this

- How razor pages works
- Using CoreUI for dotnet admin panel
- Creating a blazor component (static)
- Using Partials
- Using custom cookie authentication (this doesn't use the builtin identityuser)
- Framework provided services (Dependency Injection)
- JSON handling, alternatives for DTOs
- Services for API client
- routing for razorpages
- handling data returned from API
- razorpage handlers
- that razorpages ships with jQuery and Bootstrap by default!
